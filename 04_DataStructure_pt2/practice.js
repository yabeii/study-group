 * 
 * 1. Create objects that represent the stations (Shepard's Bush, Notting Hill Gate, etc.)
 * 2. Create an object that represent the entire Central line
 * 3. Create a train object that can be at a station and only move appropriately between stations (no skipping stations)

 * Try to create a solution that takes O(n) time where n is the number of stations on the line
 * 
 * ex.
